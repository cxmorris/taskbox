# Packages to install
Install Node.js.
Inside your API folder:
  Make sure you have a virtual environment. 
  Install Flask. 
  Install python dotenv. 
  Activate virtual environment using the command venv\Scripts\activate (Windows) or source/venv/bin/activate (MacOS, Unix-based)
Check that your frontend-backend connection is configured correctly: 
  In the package.json file in the taskbox directory, make sure that there is a line that says: 
  "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
  5000 is the port that runs the API backend, so we are sending requests from the React app to the API by calling our API backend the       proxy. 
# Running the application
Open two terminals. 
In the first terminal: 
  Navigate to the taskbox directory.
  Use the command npm start to run the React app on port 3000. 
In the second terminal: 
  Navigate to the taskbox directory. 
  Execute the following command for Windows: cd api && venv\Scripts\flask run --no-debugger
  Execute the following command or MacOS/Unix-based OS: cd api && source venv/bin/flask run --no-debugger
  This will run the API backend on port 5000.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
